Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Ans: Software engineering refers to a discipline that involves the development and mantainance of high quality software systems, with the application of engineering concepts. It involves coming up with a set of programs which are then linked together to form a software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Ans: Software engineering surpasses traditional programming by employing a systematic, team-oriented approach to the entire software lifecycle. While traditional programming focuses on writing code to solve specific problems, software engineering prioritizes building high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software through well-defined processes, collaboration, and a focus on long-term functionality.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Ans: This refers to the phases of developing a software.
Traditional programming often approaches projects in a linear manner, focusing solely on writing code to meet requirements without a defined process. In contrast, the software development life cycle (SDLC) adopts a structured, multi-stage approach. It involves planning, designing, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining the software. This method ensures high quality and maintainability through collaboration and defined practices.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Ans: 1. Requirements- gathering information on what is required of the system and user needs as well.
2. Design- coming up with a high level structure of the software plan
3. Implementation- writing code according to the design specification
4. Testing- checking whether the software is functioning as required and whether it meets the quality standards.
5. Deployment- releasing the software for use by the customers
6. Maintainance- providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements after software has been released.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Ans: Waterfall methodology follows a sequential approach of the various development stages and phases while agile development model is flexible and iterative. It doesn't follow a fixed sequence of operation. Waterfall method could be used to develop a software for a specific industry such as the banking or the healthcare industry where the requirements are wll-defined and unlikely to change. Agile could be used to develop a software for a rapidly changing app such as an app for a new social media platform.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Ans; Requirements engineering refers to the process of defining, gathering and documenting all the requirements and needs of a softaware system. The process involves:
1. Determination of the feasibility of study. Data is collected to evaluate the technical, operational and economical viability of the proposed software system.
2. Elicitation of the requirements. Requirements are gathered from various sources and stakeholders to be able to identify what the software should be able to provide.
3. Requirements analysis and specification. The gathered requirements are analyzed in order to narrow down on a specific list that will then be used in development of the software.
4. Requirement verification and validation. the requirements are then reviewed to ensure they meet all the needs of the stakeholders and confirmed to be the complete list of requirements.
5. Requirement management- the requirements are the consistently tracked and managed throughout the development life cycle.

Importance of requirement engineering includes:
1. Ensuring the developed software meets the stakeholders expectations and needs.
2. Helps to identify potential issues and problems in the development process.
3. Reduces the risk of project failure.
4. Reduces the risk of errors


Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Ans: Modularity is a principle in software engineering that works on dividing software systems into smaller independent modules. Modularity improves maintainability and scalability by enablin isolation of faults, by simplifying debugging and by allowing parallel development and by allowing flexibility.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit testing- tests individul components of the software to check if they are working as expected
2. Integration- tests how the different modules work together and ensures correct data flow among the modules.
3. System testing-tests the entire intergrated system. Checks end to end flow of the system.
4. Acceptance testing- tests the system from the end-user perspective to ensure it meets their expectations and needs.
Testing is crucial in software development for the following reasons:
1. Enables identification of bugs and defects early.
2. Improves customer satisfaction.
3. Enhanced user experience.
4. Improved software quality

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Ans: Version control systems are software tools that help manage changes to code and enable developers to track changes on the code and maintain a history of their code base.
Importance of version control systems:
1. Improved collaboration
2. Ensures code integrity
3. Makes it possible to revert to previous versions
4. Enables branching and merging
Popular version control systems:
1. Git
2. Mercurial
3. Subversion
4. Perforce
Features of the above version control systems:
1. Version tagging
2. Access control


Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Project managers play a key role in the planning, execution and closing of projects. Some of their key roles include:
1. Project planning-they define the scope of the project, come up with schedules and allocate necessary resources.
2. Team management- they oversee the team ensuring efficient collaboration
3. Risk management- Identifying potential risks and developing mitigation plans
4. Monitoring and tracking- they track the progress of the project and make necessary adjustments.
5. Quality assurance- assuring high quality software
Challenges faced:
1. Resource contraints
2. Communication silos
3. Unclear requirements
4. Working with problematic stakeholders
5. Team motivation.
6. Managing changes

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ans: Software maintainance refers to the process of updating and modifying software
Types of maintainance activities include:
1. Corrective maintenance- fixing bugs and errors that cause a system to malfunction
2. Adaptive maintanence- modifying the software to fit the user's needs
3. Perfective maintainence-enhancing the performance of the software
4. Preventive maintanence- proactive measures to prevent the occurence of problems in the future
Essence of maintainance in the software life cycle
1. Ensured functionality
2. Improved user satisfaction
3. Enhanced security
4. Enhanced adaptability

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues
1. Privacy concerns
2. Security vulnerbilities
3. Intellectual property
4. Algorithmic bias
Adherance to ethical standards
1.  Prioritize user safety
2.  Continous learning
3.  Transparency and user consent
4.  Following professional codes of conduct
5.  Collaboration with colleagues
6.  Implememnting appropriate security measures
